### **Naming Conventions**
- **Files**: All filenames should follow `snake_case` to ensure consistency and readability. This is particularly important in team settings where multiple developers will work on the project. Example: `player_data.gd`, `game_manager.js`.
- **Classes**: Classes should use `PascalCase`, making it easier to distinguish them from functions or variables. Example: `PlayerManager`, `GameManager`.
- **Variables**: Variables are written in `camelCase` for clarity and readability, ensuring that their purpose is obvious at a glance. Example: `playerStats`, `totalCoins`.
- **Constants**: Constants should use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` to differentiate them from other variables, signaling that their values should not be modified during the program's runtime. Example: `MAX_LIVES`, `BASE_SCORE`.
- **Functions**: Functions should use `camelCase` as well, maintaining consistency with variables. This helps to identify functions easily within the codebase. Example: `calculateScore`, `savePlayerData`.
